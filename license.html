            <br>
            PREAMBLE<br>
            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
            with others.<br>
            <br>
            The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br>
            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
            <br>
            DEFINITIONS<br>
            "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
            Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>

            <br>
            "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br>
            copyright statement(s).<br>
            <br>
            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>
            distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br>
            <br>
            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>
            or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br>
            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br>
            new environment.<br>
            <br>
            "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br>

            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
            a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>
            redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br>
            Software, subject to the following conditions:<br>
            <br>
            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>
            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br>
            <br>
            2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br>
            redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br>
            contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br>
            included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br>
            in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br>
            binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br>
            <br>
            3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
            Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
            Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
            presented to the users.<br>
            <br>
            4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
            Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>

            Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br>
            permission.<br>
            <br>
            5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
            must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>
            distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br>
            remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br>
            using the Font Software.<br>
            <br>
            TERMINATION<br>
            This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br>
            not met.<br>
